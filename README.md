# sbeditor

This is **not** sbeditor but i called it that anyway. it sucks because I suck. but i am going to try and make it anyway and fail. there is a reason why this repo was private though the commit messages are viewable on a certain chat app via a webhook so i have to be careful. dont let anyone get ideas...

unfortunately i had to make the repo public to enable github pages
