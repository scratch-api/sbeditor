# sbeditor

This is the successor to [sbeditor](https://github.com/faretek0/sbeditor) and [sa.editor](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/tree/9fa9a905d4e9708da67d77ae82752f820ee658ea/scratchattach/editor),
which were written in python.
They had a lot of issues regarding code style/typing as well as being quite slow.
That's why it's being rewritten in rust. When a stable release is made here, it will immediately become V3,
since v1 = original sbeditor, and v2 = sa.editor. I plan to replace sa.editor with this using a rust binding for python.

unfortunately i had to make the repo public to enable github pages
